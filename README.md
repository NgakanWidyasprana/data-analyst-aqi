# Hello 👋🏻, Welcome to My Streamlit App

## **What is this Project?**
This project analyzes air quality data (AQI Index) in Beijing, China.  
You can access the dataset here: [Air Quality Dataset](https://github.com/marceloreis/HTI/tree/master).

## **How to Run It?**
You can run this project using two methods. Before starting, make sure to download or clone this repository to access all required files.
```
$git clone <repository_url>
```
Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository.

### **Method 1: Run Locally**
1. **Install Streamlit**

    Install the Streamlit library using pip:
